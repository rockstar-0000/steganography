# Steganography

This project consists of two parts which are image steganography using some extensive Python libraries like CV2, numpy and PIL and video steganography using stegano library. The tkinter library is used for GUI.
The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. Unlike cryptography, which conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography conceals the very fact that a message is communicated.

### Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Implementation
- Image steganography

    1. To run encryption part

    python encrypt.py

    2. To run decryption part

    python decrypt.py

- Video steganography

    python video_stegano.py

    To do this video steganography, ffmpeg should be installed on your machine.

It is just simple, but somewhat interesting work.
Thanks for your time.
